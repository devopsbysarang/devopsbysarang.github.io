Kubernetes on Google Cloud can feel overwhelming with so many features â€” from cluster creation and networking to scaling, security, and enterprise capabilities.  
To make the journey structured and achievable, I created this **11-day roadmap** that covers everything from the fundamentals to advanced enterprise use cases.  

This plan is designed to help you build **hands-on GKE expertise step by step**, while staying consistent and avoiding information overload.
