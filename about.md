    <h3>DevOps Engineer</h3>

    <p>
      I am a DevOps Engineer with over 4.5 years of experience designing, deploying, and optimizing infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines for enterprise-grade applications. My work spans multiple continents, collaborating with global teams to deliver high-availability, scalable solutions that drive efficiency and reliability.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have successfully implemented multi-regional, active-active deployments for critical projects, providing seamless user experiences across geographies. From configuring Kubernetes clusters with Rancher and AWS EKS to automating deployment pipelines with Jenkins, Docker, and Ansible, I focus on delivering robust and maintainable systems. I am passionate about security and reliability, enforcing IAM best practices, integrating ELB with auto-scaling, and establishing hybrid cloud connectivity to ensure business continuity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond infrastructure, I drive innovation by implementing advanced automation and intelligent workflows to streamline operations. I have designed and managed monitoring and observability across complex systems, automated critical processes, and optimized deployment pipelines. I thrive on tackling challenging problems, enhancing operational efficiency, and mentoring teams to adopt mature DevOps practices.
    </p>

    <p>
      I enjoy taking on challenging projects that require both technical expertise and strategic thinking. I aim to create systems that are not only functional but elegant, scalable, and future-proof. My goal is to continue building resilient, efficient, and automated infrastructure while staying at the forefront of cloud and DevOps technologies.
